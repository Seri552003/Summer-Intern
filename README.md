## 🎯 Objective

Manual process planning in manufacturing is time-consuming, experience-dependent, and prone to sequencing errors. This project builds an AI-driven system that **automatically constructs, evaluates, validates, and self-corrects** manufacturing process plans — converting a raw part specification (material, geometric features, tolerance, batch size) into an optimized, machine-ready process route, presented through a live interactive dashboard.

Given a part's features, the system:

1. **Extracts** machining features automatically from a 2D engineering drawing or sketch using a Vision Language Model (VLM), or accepts manual feature selection.
2. **Constructs** a complete, precedence-valid manufacturing route (guaranteed to cover every requested feature).
3. **Groups operations by machine** (Lathe/Milling) to minimize costly changeovers.
4. **Scores** every candidate route on Time, Cost (₹), and Energy using dimension- and material-aware physical formulas.
5. **Optimizes** across these objectives with NSGA-II to surface the best trade-off — not just one arbitrary answer.
6. **Validates** every route (rule-based or LLM-generated) against a shared precedence rule set, self-correcting automatically on failure.
7. **Presents** the result on an interactive dashboard, with full traceability for every number shown.

An **LLM Planner** (Qwen3.6-27B via Groq) runs alongside the Route Builder as an additional candidate-route source, generating a plan directly from tokenized features. Its output passes through the identical FSM validation and self-correction path as every rule-based candidate — it is never trusted without verification.

### Core Design Principles

- **Image-driven feature extraction** — a VLM reads the uploaded 2D drawing and identifies machining features automatically; the user can review and edit before running the pipeline.
- **Completeness by construction** — a route is built feature-by-feature from a Feature-to-Operations mapping and a precedence graph, so a requested feature can never be silently omitted.
- **Machine-aware by default** — operations are grouped onto a single machine wherever the feature set allows, and a changeover is introduced only when genuinely unavoidable.
- **Physically grounded costing** — time and cost are derived from real manufacturing formulas (cutting speed, feed rate, multi-pass depth) using the part's actual dimensions and material, not fixed lookups.
- **No hidden numbers** — every total (time, cost) is decomposed into its components, and every tool/position change is individually traceable to its cause.
- **Trade-offs shown, not hidden** — multi-objective optimization surfaces the full set of good routes (the Pareto front), letting the user decide what matters most for a given job.
- **AI is verified, not trusted** — an LLM-generated route is checked against the exact same correctness rules as every rule-based route before it is ever used.

## 🖼️ Image-Based Feature Extraction

The most distinctive user-facing feature of the system: instead of manually selecting operations from a dropdown, the user uploads a 2D engineering drawing (PNG, JPG, or sketch photo) and the system extracts machining features automatically.

### How It Works

1. The uploaded image is sent to **Qwen3.6-27B Vision** (via Groq API) with a structured prompt listing all 22 valid feature names and asking the model to identify which are present.
2. The model returns a structured JSON response listing detected features, a confidence level, and notes explaining what it saw in the drawing.
3. The response is parsed and validated against the feature vocabulary — unrecognized terms are flagged and shown to the user separately.
4. Detected features are pre-filled into a **confirmation multiselect** — the user can add, remove, or correct before running the pipeline.

### What It Can Read

The extractor is designed to work on a range of drawing types:
- Formal dimensioned engineering drawings (ISO/ASME standard)
- CAD-generated 2D views
- Hand sketches or photos showing visible machining features (holes, slots, tapers, keyways, etc.)

Dimensions are **not required** — the extractor identifies feature types from geometry and annotation, not from numeric values.

## 🗺️ Route Only Mode — How It Works

This is the primary interface mode: a fast, dimension-free view of the recommended route and its trade-offs.

### Step 1 — User Input

Via the sidebar, the user: uploads a **2D engineering drawing** (AI extracts features automatically) or selects features manually. Then selects **Material**, **Tolerance**, **Batch Size**, and **Machine Preference** (Auto / Prefer Lathe / Prefer Milling), then clicks **Generate Process Plan**.

### Step 2 — Tokenization

The specification is converted into a fixed token sequence by dictionary lookup against `token_map.json`. Malformed input is rejected here, before anything downstream runs.

### Step 3 — Dynamic Route Construction

For the requested feature set, `route_builder.py` computes the required operations (merging overlapping requirements across features) and produces one or more valid orderings via a randomized topological sort — every candidate is complete and precedence-valid by construction.

### Step 4 — Machine-Aware Grouping

Each required operation is classified Lathe-only, Milling-only, or Shared. Shared operations are assigned to minimize machine changeovers (or steered by the user's preference); a route collapses onto a single machine whenever the feature set allows it, and a changeover marker — with its own time/cost/energy penalty — is inserted only when genuinely unavoidable.

### Step 5 — Multi-Agent Scoring (Reference Dimensions)

Each candidate route is scored by four agents — Time, Cost (₹), Energy, and a composite Efficiency score — using reference part dimensions (Ø25 mm, L = 50 mm, depth = 20 mm) so a route can be evaluated before exact dimensions are known.

### Step 6 — NSGA-II Pareto Selection

Where multiple valid routes exist, NSGA-II compares them by dominance, computes the non-dominated (Pareto) front, and selects the best overall trade-off, while the full front remains visible to the user.

### Step 7 — FSM Validation

The selected route is checked against the shared precedence rule set used to construct it, as an independent safety net.

### Step 8 — Dashboard Output

- **Color-coded route flow** — amber (Lathe), blue (Milling), purple (Shared), dark (Facing/Inspection), dashed amber (Machine Changeover).
- **Time Breakdown** — five metrics (Machining, Tool Change, Position Change, Changeover, Total) with a bar chart.
- **"Where changes occurred"** — an expandable, line-by-line trace of every tool change and position change and its cause.
- **Pareto Front** — interactive 3D (Time × Cost × Energy) and 2D (Time vs Cost, bubble = Energy) charts, with the selected route highlighted.
- **Completeness verification** — explicit confirmation that every requested feature is covered.
- **Feature → Operation mapping** — which operation(s) satisfy each requested feature, and on which machine.

## 🤖 LLM Integration — Where and How AI Is Used

Two distinct AI components are used in this system:

### 1. VLM Feature Extractor (Image Input)

**Model:** Qwen3.6-27B Vision via Groq API
**Role:** Reads an uploaded 2D engineering drawing and identifies which of the 22 machining features are present.
**File:** `week1/image_feature_extractor.py`

### 2. LLM Process Planner (Route Generation)

**Model:** Qwen3.6-27B via Groq API
**Role:** Generates a candidate process route directly from tokenized features, as a second independent path alongside the rule-based Route Builder.
**File:** `week2/llm_planner.py`

### Where the LLM Planner Sits in the Pipeline

```

(rule-based construction)  (generates a candidate route directly)
        │                          │
        └────────────┬─────────────┘
                      ▼
         FSM Validator (same 32-rule check for BOTH)
                      ▼
         Self-Correction (if invalid) → Route Builder called directly
                      ▼
              Multi-Agent Scoring → NSGA-II → Output
```

### What the Model Is Given

```
System Prompt (simplified):
"You are a manufacturing process planning expert.
 RULES: 1. Every plan MUST start with Facing, end with Inspection
        2. Use ONLY these valid operations: [full 41-operation list]
        3. Respect machining precedence
        4. Output ONLY a JSON array, nothing else"

User Prompt:
"Material: Steel, Features: Thread, Fillet, Tolerance: 0.02mm, Batch: 500"

Model Output:
["Facing", "External Threading", "Corner Rounding/Filleting", "Inspection"]
```
